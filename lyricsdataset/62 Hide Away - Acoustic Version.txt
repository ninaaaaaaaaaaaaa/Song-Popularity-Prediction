Boys seem to like the girls
Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
She's got her both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guess she's just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
She's a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
Boys seem to like the girls
Who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather be a man
Who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
To supply all of her heart's demands
Suit and tie cause under cover
I wanna save her life like superman
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
She' a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Won't somebody tell me, tell me
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Somebody tell me, tell me
Tell me where the good boys go
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
She's a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
Hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
