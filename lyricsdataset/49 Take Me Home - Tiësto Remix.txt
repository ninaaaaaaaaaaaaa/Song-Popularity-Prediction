Wrapped up, so consumed by all this hurt
If you ask me, don't know where to start
Anger, love, confusion, roads that go nowhere
I know that somewhere better 'cause you always take me there
Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now
Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?
If I'm lyin' here?
Will you take me home?
Could you take care
Of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?

Hold the gun to my head
Count one, two, three
If it helps me walk away then it's what I need
Every minute gets easier
The more you talk to me
You rationalize my darkest thoughts
Yeah, you set them free
Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now
Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?
If I'm lyin' here?
Will you take me home?
Could you take care
Of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?

You say space will make it better
And time will make it heal
I won't be lost forever
And soon I wouldn't feel
Like I'm haunted, oh-oh, falling
Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?
If I'm lying here?
Will you take me home?
