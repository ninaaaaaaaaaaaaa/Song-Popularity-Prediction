Woke up cold with the window open
Middle of the night still lying alone

And did I drink too much again, can I get out of my head?

If I stare at my phone long enough will it explode
We could talk but what's the use, I always say too much too soon
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand up
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Cold rain in the summer
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Not dressed for the weather, but you never looked better
Moving on like it's real to me
Playing the role even when the scene ends
I can act like nothing hurts, say the lines till something works
If I stare at the light long enough will I go blind?
We could talk but what's the use, when I just want a reason to see you
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand up
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Cold rain in the summer
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Not dressed for the weather, but you never looked better
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand up
I'll step back, I wanna get out
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Cold rain in the summer
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Not dressed for the weather, but you never looked better
Never looked better
