I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back even though I'm terrified
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah
Oh my God, I can't believe it, out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind 'cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell is a battle I cannot fight
I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do
I know that it's wrong

But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah
Oh my God, I can't believe it, out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind 'cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell is a battle I cannot fight
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Oh my God, I can't believe it, out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind 'cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell is a battle I cannot fight
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down

Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
