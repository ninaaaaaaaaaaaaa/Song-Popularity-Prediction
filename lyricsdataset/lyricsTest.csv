Adele - Oh My God,"I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back even though I'm terrified
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah
Oh my God, I can't believe it, out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind 'cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell is a battle I cannot fight
I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do
I know that it's wrong

But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Hmm yeah
Hmm yeah
Oh my God, I can't believe it, out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind 'cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell is a battle I cannot fight
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Oh my God, I can't believe it, out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe baby I'm just losing my mind 'cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell is a battle I cannot fight
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down

Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me
I said lord don't let me let me down

Just Don't Know It Yet,"Keep me high, keep me breathing
Before my head hits the ground (hey)
Thought I was fine with believing
But I found my way out

My father said, ""Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout a thing""
My father said, ""There's a reason, hear me calling""
He said, ""Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow, don't you ever forget
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet""

You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet, yet
You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet


(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet, yet (hey, hey)
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet

I believe in a feeling
It's more than you know (hey)
Give me life, give me meaning
And I will never let go

My father said, ""Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout a thing""
My father said, ""There's a reason, hear me calling""
He said, ""Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow, don't you ever forget
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet""

You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet, yet
You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet
You just don't know it yet
You just don't know it
You just don't know it yet, know it yet, know it yet
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet"
Memory,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale, cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun"
