Change my attempt good intentions

Crouched over, you were not there
Living in fear, but signs were not really that scarce
Obvious tears, but I will not hide you through this
I want you to help them, please see
The bleeding heart perched on my shirt
Die, withdraw, hide in cold sweat
Quivering lips, ignore remorse
Naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I?
Crowned hopeless, the article read living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red, but I will not hide you through this
I want you to help
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I?

Heave the silver hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim
Turn and tremble be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste
Eventually you'll one day know
Change my attempt good intentions
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition
Should I, could I?
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I?

(Should I, could I?)
