Don't look so concerned
You can paint a bigger picture
When you're so far off the ground
Well it's okay if you're another one to learn
You've been smoking in the kitchen
Drinking wine thats not your own
We saw it coming
You've been dancing on your own too long
The joker of the night
You know we're all not here for nothing
Like a fire in the distance
I can see but I can't help
So nothing's changed
You've been lying through your teeth again
The lion's lost it's mane
You've been cornered into something you can't win
Whats the point in having something
If that something makes you thin?
We saw it coming
You've been dancing on your own too long
The joker of the night
You know we're all not here for nothing
Like a fire in the distance
I can see but I can't help
We know you, you're not yourself
Fed up now, we'll get there soon
Take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow
We know you, you're not yourself
Fed up now, we'll get there soon
Take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow
