Keep me high, keep me breathing
Before my head hits the ground (hey)
Thought I was fine with believing
But I found my way out

My father said, "Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout a thing"
My father said, "There's a reason, hear me calling"
He said, "Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow, don't you ever forget
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet"

You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet, yet
You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet


(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet, yet (hey, hey)
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet

I believe in a feeling
It's more than you know (hey)
Give me life, give me meaning
And I will never let go

My father said, "Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout a thing"
My father said, "There's a reason, hear me calling"
He said, "Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow, don't you ever forget
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet"

You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet, yet
You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet
You just don't know it yet
You just don't know it
You just don't know it yet, know it yet, know it yet
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet
