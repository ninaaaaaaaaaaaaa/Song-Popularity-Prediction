I wanna stay in your arms
I wanna sway just where you are
I'm gonna fight all those soldiers

To hear down your voice

I want to stand up, facing the rising sun
Making dreams all around us
We have life, we have life
Kenya, can you hear me down?
Can you hear me down?
Oh, Kenya, I won't let you down
Down on the ground
Oh, Kenya, can you hear me down?
Can you hear me down?
Oh, Kenya, I won't let you down
Down on the ground
I wanna hold you and never let you go
I gotta find a way to get you on my road
Gotta make some place in my life
For you to lay down by my side
I want to stand up, facing the rising sun
Making dreams all around us
We have the life, we have the life
We have to rise
Kenya, can you hear me down?
Can you hear me down?
Oh, Kenya, I won't let you down
Down on the ground
Oh, Kenya, can you hear me down?
Can you hear me down?
Oh, Kenya, I won't let you down
Down on the ground
I want to stand up, facing the rising sun
Making dreams all around us
We have life, we have life
Kenya, can you hear me down?
Can you hear me down?
Oh, Kenya, I won't let you down
Down on the ground
Oh, Kenya, can you hear me down?
Can you hear me down?
Oh, Kenya, I won't let you down
Down on the ground
Kenya, can you hear me down?
Can you hear me down?
Oh, Kenya, I won't let you down
Down on the ground
