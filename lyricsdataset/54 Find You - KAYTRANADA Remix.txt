Why'd you have to go away?

Now you're back then sailed away (sailed away)
Give a pass to yesterday
And reveal your hideaway
All this time I've waited so I can get back to you
(Get back to you, get back to you)
I'll continue searching if that's the last thing I do
I knew all I had was you
Taught my mind to thinking that
I could go without you
Going far but going nowhere
But I found somewhere to go
I'm going home to find you
Oh, no matter where you are
I will never be too far
Girl, the worst has yet to dawn
I will still be holdin' on
All this time I've waited so I can get back to you
(Get back to you, get back to you)
I'll continue searching if that's the last thing I do
I knew all I had was you
Taught my mind to thinking that
I could go without you
Going far but going nowhere
But I found somewhere to go
I'm going home to find you
I knew all I had was you
Taught my mind to thinking that
I could go without you
Going far but going nowhere
But I found somewhere to go
I'm going home to find you

Going far but going nowhere
But I found somewhere to go, go
