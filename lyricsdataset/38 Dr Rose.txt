Got the ho's teeth done, I sent the ho to Dr. Rose
Brand new Dior Python, yeah, I'm coppin' those
On a light day, got a fifty rockin' Retros
I was out in Portland grabbin' bags, seen Damian Lillard
Brand new TEC cost a hundred and we playin' with it
Compact four-five, the green beam came with it
Had to read my horoscope to make a couple things clear
Had to cop royal blue Balencis, they was too hard
I'ma let some shots ring out like a shooting guard
I just made a forty from the Barclays debit card
I was out in Humboldt County, hit me with the 'za
but the duffle bag Goyard
Serve Jackie O, in the trap watchin' Ozark
Just to pay a nigga what he want, you need three labels
Breakin' down bud on the fiv\uc0\u1077 -rack coffee table

Plug sent the load, I ain't lik\uc0\u1077  it, got sent back
Young nigga bored, so I made him go spin back
He don't know the address, spin the whole cul-de-sac
Drac' with a biscuit and it came with a shoulder strap
Unc' sent the pack when it came, it was deep-fried
Say you got a plug with the bag with a cheap price
Shawty can't shop in the trap, got denied
I was in the trenches with the gang like a D line
I was shootin' a movie with the bitch like a GoPro
509, out in Dallas like I'm Romo
Opps don't get spinned, roll 'em in a fronto
Flip the whole car, you gotta fix it up with Bondo
I'ma beat the pack in the trap like I'm Mondo
Ballin' on you niggas in LA like I'm Lonzo
You ain't finna shoot it, what the fuck you got a gun for?
Still in the trenches 'cause a nigga really want smoke

Got the ho's teeth done, I sent the ho to Dr. Rose
Brand new Dior Python, yeah, I'm coppin' those
On a light day, got a fifty rockin' Retros
I was out in Portland grabbin' bags, seen Damian Lillard
Brand new TEC cost a hundred and we playin' with it
Compact four-five, the green beam came with it
Had to read my horoscope to make a couple things clear
Had to cop royal blue Balencis, they was too hard
I'ma let some shots ring out like a shooting guard
I just made a forty from the Barclays debit card
I was out in Humboldt County, hit me with the 'za
 but the duffle bag Goyard
Serve Jackie O, in the trap watchin' Ozark
Just to pay a nigga what he want, you need three labels
Breakin' down bud on the five-rack coffee table


Had to cop the Rover truck, I made a few juggs in it
Too much drip, closet ain't got room in it
One stick, one compact, got the tool with me
One lightskin, one dark, got two with me
Three-month run, no sweat, made two million
Had to tee up the profile, got too many
I'ma get some M's, I don't care what it cost
He gon' catch a body for the Circle, he don't care what the cost
Yeah, pull up with the block out, nigga, we gon' pop shit
We gon' treat them niggas like mosquitos, we gon' off shit
Me and JRoc countin' up, eatin' crawfish
Go in with the blitz like a nigga playin' offense
Niggas say they took somethin' from me, that's nonsense
Cartier havin', these baguettes with the blue lens
Two-rack sweatsuit plain with the Retros
Ridin' in the Sprinter with the TV and white seats
We gon' leave a nigga out stretched with a white sheet
Size fourteen, servin' in Dior, got big feet
They was thirteen twenty-five, I just bought three
I'ma flee every time, they ain't never caught me
Shawty disappointed, she say, "You ain't never call me"
I was playin' music, fuckin' lil' shawty offbeat
I'm a real plug, I ain't talkin' to you pipsqueaks
Fuck it, I'ma go and get the Urus next week
