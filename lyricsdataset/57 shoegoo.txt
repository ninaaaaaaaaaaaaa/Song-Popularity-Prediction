Shoe more goo than shoe
Do what you gotta do
Cannot follow through
Do what you gotta do
Cut me up make me new
Do what you gotta do
Held together with...
Mirror a voyeur
Like, oh it's a ghost
Concrete esophagus
Filling the host
Bodied and swallowing
Taking the most
Chopping injecting and
Hold me together with
Dripping and guzzling
Out from the bone
Frenzied and stuttering
I've always known
Body topography
Is this an autopsy
I won't condone all this
Mutilation and reconfiguration
Swallow my pieces for
Perfect duplication
Forget to swallow for
Disassociation
Taking it out of me
Taking it out
Dying to make this the time of our lives
None of that matters in this configuration
Waterfalls tumbling out of my eyes
Goo me together
Goo me back up
Oohh
Shoe more goo than shoe
What's it mean to you
Nothing you see is true
Turn me into goo
Squeezing it out of you
What was one is two
Am I enough for you?
I won't condone all this
Stimulation and rehabilitation
Fuck reality
Transient the nation
Nothing can help with this
Disassociation
Taking it out of me
Taking it all
Dying to make this the time of our lives
None of that matters in this configuration
Waterfalls tumbling out of my eyes
Goo me together
Goo me back up
What did they do to you
I knew you better
You used to be so clean
Is this what's left of you
All pieced together
Are all reflections so mean
Mutilation and transubstantiation
Change my body into
Something less than it was
Shoe more goo than shoe
Nothing more we can do
Break me down, make me new
You never listened to me
I tried to tell you to stop
I watched you throw it away
I watched you carve out your heart
(Shoe more goo than shoe)
And yeah you're moving along
(Make me something new)
But how much time have you got
(Shoe more goo than shoe)
You could have been anything
