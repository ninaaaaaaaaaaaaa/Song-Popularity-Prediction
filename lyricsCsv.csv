Name,Lyrics
Mombasa,"Stranded naked on the sandbar
Echoed from the stars
Neon
Sea snake cemetery roaming under dusk

Doberman visions
You're undressing
Mute and bleary

Hillside castles baking down to sand
Hillside castles baking down to sand

Shamed red Chopin
Plays awful sounds from the dresser
Nurse's hands carving in slate
Hummingbird gestures

Sleeping in nectar
Teething on freedom
Sleeping in nectar
Teething on freedom

The hospital bed filled with your apathy
In a haze of heat, a father hums his tragic song
Before the cold sees its ceremony
Oh, in your icy eyes
The daybreak glance given

Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now

Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now"
Moment (feat. Wiz Khalifa),"This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Nobody's a no one

I'm gleaming
I'm the me I see when I be dreaming
I remember thinking that I'd never see it
I remember thinking that I'd never be it
Now I pay my mom's lease with an appearance fee
'Cause they screaming my name I must be hearing things
But nah, it's all, it's all for you
Your life, your dreams, they all for you

This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Nobody's a no one

I just wanna roll one
They gon' talk about you bad until they see you glow up
Put me in your building, need a half a mil to show up
I don't see the dealer, need a pound and I'ma grow one
Hop in the coupe and I'm swerving lanes
No new friends, I'm curvin' lames
My niggas solid, stay the same
I see the top, that's my favorite place
Going to work, don't got time to waste
Takin' my time, I ain't trying to race
I'ma stay all on my grind
Stackin' my G's to the sky
Rollin' that weed with my guys

This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Nobody's a no one

Nobody's a no one
I don't sound like no one
Did this on my own, huh
I feel just like Goku or Gohan, I go on
I threw up on Wiz, nigga
I still made it big nigga
You can't tell me shit nigga

This feel like my chance
This feel like my moment
Everyone needs a fan
Everyone needs a close up
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Let me see your hands up high, if you know one
Nobody's a no one"
Let's Make Love,"I was born with greed and Evil, sin
It's in my flesh
I trust only me
I'm too blind to see
Pretending to care

It's the light at the end of the tunnel
It's the promise of heaven owner
I'm so lost in the current
In the tide and the waves and the torrent

Let's make love
Let time pass us by
Let's make love
I'll hurt, I'll be fine

If she loves then she wants freedom and free
We learn, we stand
We rise and we fall

It's the light at the end of the tunnel
It's the promise of heaven owner
I'm so lost in the current
In the tides and the waves and the torrent

Let's make love
Let time pass us by
Let's make love
I'll hurt, I'll be fine

Take me away from this place
Lets me be brave and to stay
I wanna be free, free, free
Help me to see what's free to feel"
Heaven Is a Place on Earth,"Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth

When the night falls down
I wait for you
And you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids
On the street outside

When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love...

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth

When I feel alone
I reach for you
And you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice
And it carries me

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth"
Mind Over Matter,"Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train, New York city - it rains!
Fly to east L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

Mind over matter,
I'm in tatters thinkin' about her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo - snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed!
I'm watching you this time

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
I missed that train
New York city - it rains!
Fly to east L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
All the lights aglow
Tokyo - sno-ooows
Go to watch the show - curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

Mind over matter
Mind over matter,
You know you're on my mind!

And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
I missed that train, will you stand by me!

Song the 3,"If you take a step towards me
You will take my breath away
So I'll keep you close and keep my secret safe

No one else has ever loved me
No one else has ever tried
I never understood how much I could take

Then I saw the worst was over
When I laid my eyes on you
It was all that I could do to know my place

Out of all the vast illusions
Out of all the dreams come true
I was gone until I finally saw your face

If you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you?
'Cause I know you saved me too

Let me take a step towards you
Let me feel you in my hands
Let me cross this line and show you where it leads

There's a darkness down inside me
That I know we'll both enjoy
And it's screaming from within to set it free

I have left this bloody nightmare
In my wake but out of sight
All I want is deviation by design

Out of all the past confusion
Out of all the common spite
Just tell me I am yours 'cause you are mine

And if you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you?
'Cause I know you saved me too

It doesn't really matter what you do or say
I'm never going anywhere anyway
'Cause when I'm dying for you
I've never felt so alive

If you cried out for more
If you reached out for me
I would run into the storm
Just to keep you here with me
I have gone beyond my years
I've wasted half my life
But I found it all in you
Did I save you?
'Cause I know you saved me too

I know you saved me too"

You're Somebody Else,"I saw the part of you
That only when you're older you will see too
You will see too
I held the better cards
But every stroke of luck has got a bleed through
It's got a bleed through
You held the balance of the time
That only blindly I could read you
But I could read you
It's like you told me
Go forward slowly
It's not a race to the end

Well you look like yourself
But you're somebody else
Only it ain't on the surface
Well you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous

You were the better part
Of every bit of beating heart that I had
Whatever I had
I finally sat alone
Pitch black flesh and bone
Couldn't believe that you were gone

Did you think that by in love
I'd been crashing and burning straight through the wall

Same as I ever was, I do it all because
Life's too short to not live wild
Same as I ever was, high on a couple drugs
Life's too short to not live wild
Live wild, live wild

I don't care about the consequence
I don't need it all to make any sense
You always hesitate to have a good time
I hope you're happy in your house of glass

I Am The Man,"Everybody held their breath the moment you walked through that door
Everybody thought that I would crumble when you said 'hello'
But I know something that they don't know
I've learned the art of not letting the heartache show

I am the man
Who learned how to lie
Made everyone think that I'm alright
I am the man
Who managed to smile
Foolin' the world for a little while
Seein' her tonight starts this hurtin' inside
I guarantee that she'll never know
'Cause I am the man
Who learned how to lie

I walk across the room to show the two of them how cool I am
Tryin' not to stare at the ring that's there on her left hand
I see the light of his love in her eyes
God I practiced this moment a million times

Someday
I won't be a liar
I'll let my heart feel the fire
Of falling in love again
But until then

I am the man
Who learned how to lie"
Impossible,"I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say

And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
(Tell them oh) I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible"
Lost (feat. Chelsea Jade),"You're the mouth of the tunnel just before the dark
I'm the headlights speeding through the stars
And we're lost in the spaces of who we are
And we move through the nights 'till we take it too far

Hold it together when we move apart
Let the landscape burn like a dying art
Driven by the energy in our hearts
We were built to be reckless from the start

And the light just flickers past our faces
Living in a dream 'cause we're always wasted
Never stay still when we're chasing places

And the light just flickers past our faces
Living at a dream 'cause we're always wasted
Making up our minds that we're never changing

'Cause we're getting lost and found when we're carried away
I feel it all around, even in our mistakes
And when we're up, we're down, in the evening space
We're getting lost and found, when we're carried away

When we're carried away

The truth gets tired when we lie awake
So we dive into dreams that they can't sedate
Breathe in and out, to go all the way
Trip 'till we're fixed in a higher state

And the light just flickers past our faces
Living in a dream 'cause we're always wasted
Never stay still when we're chasing places

And the light just flickers past our faces
Living at a dream 'cause we're always wasted
Making up our minds that we're never changing

'Cause we're getting lost and found when we're carried away
I feel it all around, even in our mistakes
And when we're up, we're down, in the evening space
We're getting lost and found, when we're carried away

Carry me, Carry me
Carry me, Carry me
Carry me, Carry me

And the light just flickers past our faces
We're living out a dream 'cause we're always wasted
And the light just flickers past our faces
We never stay still when we're chasing places

'Cause we're getting lost and found when we're carried away
I feel it all around even in our mistakes
And when we're up, we're down, in the evening space
We're getting lost and found when we're carried away

Carry me, Carry me
Carry me, Carry me
Carry me, Carry me"
On the Road,"I left New York in 1949
To go across the country without a bad blame dime
Montana in the cold cold fall
Found my father in the gambling hall

Father, Father where you been?
I've been out in the world and I'm only ten
Father, Father where you been?
I've been out in the world and I'm only ten

Don't worry about me if I should die of pleurisy

Across to Mississippi, across to Tennessee
Across the Niagara, home I'll never be
Home in ol' Medora, home in Ol' Truckee
Apalachicola, home I'll never be

Better or for worse, thick and thin
Like being married to the Little poor man
God he loves me (God he loves me)
Just like I love him (just like I love him)
I want you to do (I want you to do)
Just the same for him (just the same for him, yeah)

Well the worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind
So I left Monatana on an old freight train (on an old freight train)
The night my father died in the cold cold rain (in the cold cold rain)

Road to Opelousas, road to Wounded Knee
Road to Ogallala home I'll never be
Road to Oklahoma, road to El Cahon
Road to Tahachapi, road to San Antone

Hey, hey

Road to Opelousas, road to Wounded Knee
Road to Ogallala, home I'll never be

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh oh

Shooting stars shining down on your face
Dancing in the moonlight with you
You keep me calm when I'm a certain disgrace
You keep me on my toes with your moves

And you pulled me inside out and outside in
Give my heart palpitations, keep my pulse racing

Oh and I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you
Yeah you make my head spin with the things that you do
I feel dizzy when you tell me you love me too
I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you

You're making magic got me under your spell
Girl you got the music in you
I'm falling for you and I know you can tell
'Cause you're reciprocating it too

You turned me upside down and downside up
Give me an education, how to fall in love

Oh and I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you
Yeah, you make my head spin with the things that you do
I feel dizzy when you tell me you love me too
I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you

Oh no, sing it to me now
And I'm head over heels and heels over head
You're the only explanation for my discombobulation, baby

I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you
Yeah you make my head spin with the things that you do
I feel dizzy when you tell me you love me too
I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you

I can't see straight when I'm thinking 'bout you

Doing It Wrong,"When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying

Yo Soy Tu Maestro,"Baby, I'll be there, esperando por tu amor
A ti como que se te olvida con quién tú estás hablando

Yo soy tu maestro, quien supo enseñarte
Fui el segundo en tu vida, pero el primero en amarte
¿Cómo es posible que me digas que lo amas?

De tu cuerpo yo conozco hasta la más intima parte
¿Cómo es posible que me digas que lo amas?
Cuando yo sé que soy el dueño de tu cama


Cuando estabas afligida en mí tú encontraste amor
Me creías capaz de los que romperían tú corazón
Junto a mí tus días tristes volvieron a ver el sol
Y ahora tú me dices que has vuelto contigo amor
Y que lo quieres, lo amas y con él vas a casarte
Tratas de hacerme sufrir para que un día llegue a odiarte
Pero mientras más lo intentas, mi amor se hace más grande


Yo soy tu maestro, quien supo enseñarte
Fui el segundo en tu vida, pero el primero en amarte
¿Cómo es posible que me digas que lo amas?

De tu cuerpo yo conozco hasta la más intima parte
¿Cómo es posible que me digas que lo amas?
Cuando yo sé que soy el dueño de tu cama


Lo que me dices, ""Cool hermano, te debes resignar""
Y ese es el tipo de consejos que no quiero escuchar
No puedo seguir viviendo, si a mi lado tú no estás


Vuelve, te necesito, mujer ideal
Vuelve, mi cuerpo extraña tu calor
Vuelve, te necesito, mujer ideal
Vuelve, que estoy ardiendo de pasión

De tu cuerpo yo conozco hasta la más intima parte
¿Cómo es posible que me digas que lo amas?
Cuando yo sé que soy el dueño de tu cama


Y yo recuerdo aquellos besos como si hubiesen sido ayer
Lo dulce de tus labios, que para mí sabían a miel
Mi cuerpo poco a poco adentrándose en tu ser
Oh, cash, y lo tierno de tu piel
Susurros en tus oídos que te hacian excitar
Lo bien que nos sentiamos a la hora de amar
Cada minuto, cada segundo lo soliamos disfrutar, baby
Pero ahora ya no estás

I said lord don't let me let me down
Lord don't let me, I said lord don't let me

Just Don't Know It Yet,"Keep me high, keep me breathing
Before my head hits the ground (hey)
Thought I was fine with believing
But I found my way out

My father said, ""Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout a thing""

He said, ""Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow, don't you ever forget
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet""

You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet, yet

You just don't know it yet, yet, yet, yet, yet (hey, hey)
You will find that heaven's in you, you just don't know it yet

Give me life, give me meaning
And I will never let go

Memory,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale, cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun"

Rose Dr,"Got the ho's teeth done, I sent the ho to Dr. Rose
Brand new Dior Python, yeah, I'm coppin' those
On a light day, got a fifty rockin' Retros
I was out in Portland grabbin' bags, seen Damian Lillard
Brand new TEC cost a hundred and we playin' with it
Compact four-five, the green beam came with it
Had to read my horoscope to make a couple things clear
Had to cop royal blue Balencis, they was too hard
I'ma let some shots ring out like a shooting guard
I just made a forty from the Barclays debit card
I was out in Humboldt County, hit me with the 'za
but the duffle bag Goyard
Serve Jackie O, in the trap watchin' Ozark
Just to pay a nigga what he want, you need three labels
Breakin' down bud on the fiv\uc0\u1077 -rack coffee table

Plug sent the load, I ain't lik\uc0\u1077  it, got sent back
Young nigga bored, so I made him go spin back
He don't know the address, spin the whole cul-de-sac
Drac' with a biscuit and it came with a shoulder strap
Unc' sent the pack when it came, it was deep-fried
Say you got a plug with the bag with a cheap price
Shawty can't shop in the trap, got denied
I was in the trenches with the gang like a D line
I was shootin' a movie with the bitch like a GoPro
509, out in Dallas like I'm Romo
Opps don't get spinned, roll 'em in a fronto
Flip the whole car, you gotta fix it up with Bondo
I'ma beat the pack in the trap like I'm Mondo
Ballin' on you niggas in LA like I'm Lonzo
You ain't finna shoot it, what the fuck you got a gun for?
Still in the trenches 'cause a nigga really want smoke

Got the ho's teeth done, I sent the ho to Dr. Rose

Had to cop the Rover truck, I made a few juggs in it
Too much drip, closet ain't got room in it
One stick, one compact, got the tool with me
One lightskin, one dark, got two with me
Three-month run, no sweat, made two million
Had to tee up the profile, got too many

Go in with the blitz like a nigga playin' offense
Niggas say they took somethin' from me, that's nonsense
Cartier havin', these baguettes with the blue lens
Two-rack sweatsuit plain with the Retros
Ridin' in the Sprinter with the TV and white seats
We gon' leave a nigga out stretched with a white sheet
Size fourteen, servin' in Dior, got big feet
They was thirteen twenty-five, I just bought three
I'ma flee every time, they ain't never caught me
Shawty disappointed, she say, ""You ain't never call me""

Who Needs You,"I make it half past six you come at seven
Always try to keep me hanging round
You little spoilt thing girl you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs well I don't need who needs you?
Oh I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand
Where is that helping hand? (Oh, muchachos)
Ooh, well I don't need you
How I was pushed around?
Don't let it get you down
You walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget
Reaching out (reaching out) for a helping (for a helping hand) hand
When I met you you were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'til you were mine
You were oh so, so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say
I had to swallow my pride
So naive you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?"
Don't Let It Get You Down,"Old man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around"

Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them

Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar

No, I-I-I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover

Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

We ain't ever getting older

I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song

Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Beat up shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man
I'm workin' now

Up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody bodies pinned you but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Ah, then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man

Baby, don't you holler, darlin', don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling oh so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time

And look into your heart, pretty baby
Is it aching with some nameless need?
Is there something wrong, and you can't put your finger on it?
Right then, roll to me
And I don't think I have ever seen
A soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?
So don't try to deny it, pretty baby
You've been down so long you can hardly see
When the engine's stalled, and it won't stop raining
It's the right time to roll to me
Roll to me
Roll to me
And I don't think I have ever seen
A soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?
So look around your world, pretty baby
Is it everything you hoped it'd be?
The wrong guy, the wrong situation
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me, ooh"

Never Looked Better,"Woke up cold with the window open
Middle of the night still lying alone

And did I drink too much again, can I get out of my head?

If I stare at my phone long enough will it explode
We could talk but what's the use, I always say too much too soon
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand up
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Cold rain in the summer
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Not dressed for the weather, but you never looked better
Moving on like it's real to me
Playing the role even when the scene ends
I can act like nothing hurts, say the lines till something works
If I stare at the light long enough will I go blind?
We could talk but what's the use, when I just want a reason to see you
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand up
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Cold rain in the summer
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Not dressed for the weather, but you never looked better
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand up
I'll step back, I wanna get out
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Cold rain in the summer
Can we find our way back and live the past again

Take Me Home - Tiësto Remix,"Wrapped up, so consumed by all this hurt
If you ask me, don't know where to start
Anger, love, confusion, roads that go nowhere
I know that somewhere better 'cause you always take me there
Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now
Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?
If I'm lyin' here?
Will you take me home?
Could you take care
Of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?

Hold the gun to my head
Count one, two, three
If it helps me walk away then it's what I need
Every minute gets easier
The more you talk to me
You rationalize my darkest thoughts
Yeah, you set them free
Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now
Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?
If I'm lyin' here?
Will you take me home?
Could you take care
Of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?
Will you take me home?

You say space will make it better
And time will make it heal
I won't be lost forever
And soon I wouldn't feel
Like I'm haunted, oh-oh, falling
Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?
If I'm lying here?
Will you take me home?"

"i hate u, i love u (feat. olivia o'brien)","Feeling used but I'm still missing you

And I can't see the end of this

Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Messed around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too
And I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that
I type a text but then I 'nevermind' that
I got these feelings but you never mind that
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"

And I'm in pieces (yo), baby, fix me (uh-huh)
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream (yo, uh-huh)
I'm goin' down (oh), down, down, down (uh-huh)
And I just can't believe, my first love won't be around, and I'm like
""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
I thought you'd always be mine, mine (Luda!)
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks (woo)
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazin'
'Cause she was so amazin'
And now, my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'
""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
""Baby, baby, baby, oh""

Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""

Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""

I thought you'd always be mine, mine
I'm gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now, I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone)
I'm gone"

Find You - KAYTRANADA Remix,"Why'd you have to go away?

Now you're back then sailed away (sailed away)
Give a pass to yesterday
And reveal your hideaway
All this time I've waited so I can get back to you
(Get back to you, get back to you)
I'll continue searching if that's the last thing I do
I knew all I had was you
Taught my mind to thinking that
I could go without you
Going far but going nowhere
But I found somewhere to go
I'm going home to find you
Oh, no matter where you are
I will never be too far
Girl, the worst has yet to dawn
I will still be holdin' on

Been ballin' all my life, Lamborghini's, fast whips
She down to ride and deserves a boss who down to provide
We run the streets but on G5s, I'm talkin' fly
Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, newer rings
You with a big boy, so we do the big things
Had to valet park it, chanel hoodie on
Looking like Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted
She on my wanted poster, Ciroc in my mimosa
I'm ballin' like LeBron, we shopping in Milan
The 458 Ferrari I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb
The sex is so explosive, her stuff is supersonic
She my new addiction, I swear I'm through with-
Rozay and Usher Raymond, girl, we the hottest
Rockin' the most ice, I said we the hottest

Wasteland,"Change my attempt good intentions

Crouched over, you were not there
Living in fear, but signs were not really that scarce
Obvious tears, but I will not hide you through this
I want you to help them, please see
The bleeding heart perched on my shirt
Die, withdraw, hide in cold sweat
Quivering lips, ignore remorse
Naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I?
Crowned hopeless, the article read living wasteland
This time you've tried
All that you can turning you red, but I will not hide you through this
I want you to help
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I?

Heave the silver hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim
Turn and tremble be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste
Eventually you'll one day know
Change my attempt good intentions
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition
Should I, could I?
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I?

Like, oh it's a ghost
Concrete esophagus
Filling the host
Bodied and swallowing
Taking the most
Chopping injecting and
Hold me together with
Dripping and guzzling
Out from the bone
Frenzied and stuttering
I've always known
Body topography
Is this an autopsy
I won't condone all this
Mutilation and reconfiguration
Swallow my pieces for
Perfect duplication
Forget to swallow for
Disassociation
Taking it out of me
Taking it out
Dying to make this the time of our lives
None of that matters in this configuration
Waterfalls tumbling out of my eyes
Goo me together
Goo me back up
Oohh
Shoe more goo than shoe
What's it mean to you
Nothing you see is true
Turn me into goo
Squeezing it out of you
What was one is two
Am I enough for you?
I won't condone all this
Stimulation and rehabilitation
Fuck reality
Transient the nation
Nothing can help with this
Disassociation
Taking it out of me
Taking it all
Dying to make this the time of our lives
None of that matters in this configuration
Waterfalls tumbling out of my eyes
Goo me together
Goo me back up
What did they do to you
I knew you better
You used to be so clean
Is this what's left of you
All pieced together
Are all reflections so mean
Mutilation and transubstantiation
Change my body into
Something less than it was
Shoe more goo than shoe
Nothing more we can do
Break me down, make me new
You never listened to me
I tried to tell you to stop
I watched you throw it away
I watched you carve out your heart

And yeah you're moving along

But how much time have you got

Country Sunshine,"You say you love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, green grass beneath my feet
Running through the fields of daisies, wading through the creek
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, I'm happy with the simple things
A Saturday night dance, a picture show and the joy that a bluebird brings
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
There's just something bout the morning that make each day a joy to see
The nighttime brings a peaceful feeling that rests inside of me
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine

Speechless,"Here comes a wave
Meant to wash me away
A tide that is taking me under
Swallowing sand
Left with nothing to say
My voice drowned out in the thunder
But I won't cry
And I won't start to crumble
Whenever they try
To shut me or cut me down
I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

Written in stone
Every rule, every word
Centuries old and unbending
Stay in your place
Better seen and not heard
But now that story is ending
'Cause I
I cannot start to crumble
So come on and try
Try to shut me and cut me down
I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
Speechless
Let the storm in
I cannot be broken
No, I won't live unspoken
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless
Try to lock me in this cage
I won't just lay me down and die
I will take these broken wings
And watch me burn across the sky

Hear the echoes saying I

Won't be silenced
Though you want to see me tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
Speechless
'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless
All I know is I won't go speechless

Elephant,"Look, false personas, all is hopeless in the game now
The wrong devotion flows through those who chase the same clout
The pollen floating through the industry got this congested
I'm XXL if they fit the pen in
Fuck who they pick as freshman
I SMS it, DM it and double send it 'til they get the message
I road tripped and left with
Nothing, I been in city of angels long enough to sit and question
Their successes, who they pay, and who they get in bed with
Ooh, I can't trust a nigga (Nah)
You rub a nigga wrong
Heard to get to your position that you'd suck a nigga off
And cover ups are troublesome
They're here a couple months then back up on the struggle bus
I see, the shoe fitting well on you cinderella boys
'Cause dressin' feminine stepping in as a selling point
Renting toys, taking pics, hope you break a thousand likes
Claim you 'bout that life but niggas never see you out at night
I'ma need you to vacate the premises
You really reaching to maintain your relevance
The main reason why I don't have any friends in this is
When I'm in the room, I'm addressing the elephants
And they paying for plays and traffic
They better off playing in traffic
I've peeped game for a while, I ain't quick to judge
But I can see 'em breaking character, the jig is up
The ones that claim that they the realest always wind up being fakest
Paying for them follows, every like and every favorite
The industry's a lie, I just wish that they would rap more
Artists bigger than me seem to never seem to use they platform
I've sold out shows without selling out my soul
I'm played in different states without me ever leaving home
I made a decision to go independent
When I wasn't winning 'cause trying to fit in
Ain't something to live with when living the life I was given I get it
But I know I'll actually make it one day
When I step in the booth, I treat each record like a Sunday
A cracker sipping wine, and leave confessions for my one takes
Tracking every move, I'm face to face with Alan Nunn May
That relationship's a one way
Wanna talk numbers? Wanna talk about specifics?
If it was up to plays, I wouldn't drive around a Civic
My accomplishments is whispered by my critics
The ones that ride for me reap the benefits that come with it
I'm saying
I'ma need you to vacate the premises
You really reaching to maintain your relevance
The main reason why I don't have any friends in this is
When I'm in the room, I'm addressing the elephants
And they paying for plays and traffic
They better off playing in traffic

Hide Away - Acoustic Version,"Boys seem to like the girls
Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
She's got her both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guess she's just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
She's a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
Boys seem to like the girls
Who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather be a man
Who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
To supply all of her heart's demands
Suit and tie cause under cover
I wanna save her life like superman
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
She' a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Won't somebody tell me, tell me
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Somebody tell me, tell me
Tell me where the good boys go
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
She's a good, good girl who needs a little company

Thin,"Don't look so concerned
You can paint a bigger picture
When you're so far off the ground
Well it's okay if you're another one to learn
You've been smoking in the kitchen
Drinking wine thats not your own
We saw it coming
You've been dancing on your own too long
The joker of the night
You know we're all not here for nothing
Like a fire in the distance
I can see but I can't help
So nothing's changed
You've been lying through your teeth again
The lion's lost it's mane
You've been cornered into something you can't win
Whats the point in having something
If that something makes you thin?
We saw it coming
You've been dancing on your own too long
The joker of the night
You know we're all not here for nothing
Like a fire in the distance
I can see but I can't help

How did you get to me?
No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do

Weaving a weak alibi

Black & Gold - Radio Edit,"Mmm
If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

Mmm

I look up into the night sky
I see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you

New York Raining,"Miles from home, my style has grown
Sick of getting played like a xylophone
My instrument is me with thousands of bones
Wilin', I just wanna zone
My mama knows
I need a chick to be kinda dope
Smile a lot, give a lot of (dome)
Only to me, spoil me with your bad (ass)
You're like royalty, baby, catch that
See the rain is makin' me feel painless
This relationship is so dangerous
If they find out, what will they make of it
So I say that every kiss like a sanction
You ain't missin' a thing
With other niggas who sing
I need cash just to give you a ring
Love at first sight, but it was blocked by pain
So for you, I'll exceed the top 5 in the game
In the city lights
I swear I hear you call my name (call my name)
There's nothing right
I'm stuck here while you're miles away (miles away)
In New York raining
In New York raining
It's too much my babe I need you
It's too much my babe I need you
Red wine and cheese before bed time
You and I fell in love is the headline
Instead of whinin' about what I've been findin'
I stay silent and let you chime in
You want me to talk?, fine then
Someone broke your heart?
Let me find them
But I hate fights and now I got stage fright
Until I'm at your place at the late night
You make me smile, stop doing that
A lot is on my mind when I rap, in fact
You are a lot, I guess I rap for you
Needless to say, the (sex) is magical
After you, chivalry I have to do
I love it when you catch an attitude
I want to tease you just to laugh at you
So that make up (sex) could be a faster move
C'mon!

I swear I hear you call my name (call my name)
There's nothing right
I'm stuck here while you're miles away (miles away)
In New York raining
In New York raining
It's too much my babe I need you
It's too much my babe I need you
When the rain falls down, the pain is all out
My brain, you call out my name and that's fame
I'm looking great but I still feel shame
For real it's the game
I feel insane
But when I'm with you, my feelings change
I love you, I really hope you feel the same
You know what I am, you're holdin' my hand
No one else can so I'm your man
Your palm reads bliss
What are we miss?
You are what I miss and we all need this
Love and affection is all we miss
From the world but with each other
That's all we get
I wanna hear you out, talk to me, miss
I hardly wanna slip the awesomest kiss
Call me whenever, call me forever
As long as I can call us together
I love you

I swear I hear you call my name (call my name)
There's nothing right

All I heard was ""that boy's not""

Me Olvide De Vivir,"De tanto correr por la vida sin freno
Me olvidé que la vida se vive un momento
De tanto querer ser en todo el primero
Me olvidé de vivir

De tanto gritar mis canciones al viento
Ya no soy como ayer
Ya no sé lo que siento

Me quedé sin amor una noche de un día
De tanto jugar con quien yo más quería
Perdí, sin querer
Lo mejor que tenía
De tanto ocultar la verdad con mentiras
Me engañé sin saber que era yo quien perdía
De tanto esperar, yo que nunca ofrecía
Hoy me toca llorar
Yo que siempre reía
Me olvidé de vivir
Me olvidé de vivir
Me olvidé de vivir
Me olvidé de vivir
De tanto correr por ganar tiempo al tiempo
Queriendo robarle a mis noches el sueño
De tantos fracasos, de tantos intentos

Cada día algo nuevo

I Scare Myself,"They say I'm crazy

I might agree with that
When everything I touch will break
Loving you is my escape
So come on give me what I crave
I want it
I want it
Do you want it?
I scare myself
With the way that I need you
There's no one else
Tell me that you can feel it too
I'd crawl through hell
If it meant that I could keep you
I scare myself
I come unraveled
When you whisper my name
My head is spinning
You make me feel insane
The moment that our skin collides
There's nothing left for me to hide
I have finally learned to fly
And I want it
I want it
Do you want it?
I scare myself
With the way that I need you
There's no one else
Tell me that you can feel it too
I'd crawl through hell
If it meant that I could keep you
I scare myself
When everything I touch will break
Loving you is my escape
So come on give me what I crave
I want it
I want it
Do you want it?
I scare myself
With the way that I need you
There's no one else
Tell me that you can feel it too
I'd crawl through hell
If it meant that I could keep you
I scare myself
I scare myself"
YSIV,"It's that Young Sinatra IV shit right here
Rest in peace Mac Miller
It's been like ten years
Here we go, yeah
Visualizin' and realizin' my life is fuckin' crazy
Poppin' like Jay-Z
Dirty Dancin' on the game like Swayze
I'm one of the illest and bitch I've been ready to kill it, it's so amazin'
Bitch, I've been blazin', I'm talkin' grass, I ain't talkin' grazing
They just hit the tape while I sip scotch let the haters kick rocks
My shit is tip top and never flip-flop
Why? 'Cause my soul too strong
Did this all on my own, 'cause waiting took too long
The flow sophisticated, all these youngins do is rhyme like they inebriated
I'm hated but yeah, that's how you know I made it
I'm one of the illest, I'm one of the realest, I'm ready to kill this
The people, they feel us, me and my team made millions but you know we still us
That's why they wanna kill us, that's why they wanna kill us
RattPack real all the time, we never phony
I'm single-handedly running the game like a Sony
While the rest of these rappers is acting
Pass 'em the Tony, pass 'em the Oscar
From the new school rappers, yeah I'm the illest on the roster
Smoke like a rasta
Black and white like Bob Marley, yeah, like Bob Marley
These racist motherfuckers hate that last line
Probably haters on the internet ain't got nothing to bargain
Said I'd never make it, bitch, I just sold out the garden
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch
Like Sinatra, screamin', ""Motherfuck the cops""
They say they want the old Logic, the one that flow like a faucet
I'm still the same me, they just don't believe it like they Agnostic
If I spit over the Boom-Bap, then they perceive it as nostalgic
But the truth is, my subject matter has been the same
And my production selection is still flame
But they love you on the come up 'cause you ain't tainted by fame
And you still they little secret
That's the type of bullshit that they frequent
From 19, to 2019, been murderin' this shit for a decade
From the Boom-Bap to the Trap, I let my shits cascade, listen, yeah, yeah
So what's the dilly, pass the Phillie, get silly, that's on the really
We snappin' like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, I'm talkin' achilles
Try to play me like I ain't me, but I provided all the deets'
Who you know worth fifty million, still rappin' on break beats?
From Nasty Nas, Big-L, Tribe, The Roots, and many more
Of course we could never forget Biggie and young Shakur
Fuck the police, no we ain't fuckin' with Al Pastor
I'm the bastard that mastered the flow, I said it once before fa sho
While 6ix produce the kicks from the soul, you already know
Fuck these youngins talking outta they ass with no class, I'm here to school 'em
This that real shit, I'm never foolin'
I'm killin' these squares, we call it a mass-acre
I got the bread, but these fuckers needs the dough like a baker
The legends above me love me like the RZA, like Nas, like Jay
'Cause I mastered the flow from back in the day
Respected by my peers from Drizzy to Cole to Kenny
Thank you for the love and inspiration, plenty
Yeah I'm loved by many, and only hated by a little
Now I think it's time to switch the lyricism, peep the riddle
I was born in mint condition, I'm everybody's life's mission
Alright, listen, put me 'round your neck and I might glisten
The ultimate connect, I'll get you anything you need
From good credit, to good weed I can make any woman suck seed, control you with high degree
Along with anybody that's in need, I'll make 'em beg and plead
I'm in the pocket of mafia crime lords and presidents
Without me, they'll evict you from your residence
Hov wrote about me on Dead Presidents, never irrelevant
Not a soul on earth would love me if I weren't me
No matter what year I'm in, I'm current, see?
People that have me, yeah they power's so immense
But people without me make no sense, god damn
Yeah, the world revolve around me, the law evolve around me
The shit people do to get a piece of me astound me
Blood stains my face when drug deals go wrong
I'm given to the greatest athletes when they go long
You could put me in check, but I'm still laughing all the way to the bank
I'm the reason that the Titanic sank
I'm always there for you, yeah, when it comes down to the wire
And some people even tuck me away 'til they retire
I usually come around on the first and fifteenth
If you owe me to somebody then they'll leave you beneath
People go crazy when they feel me, in the Middle East they drill me
If you let your guard down, then some people'll steal me
I knew these two dudes that's always been homies since fifth grade
Always schemin' on the block, selling crack to get paid
Now they never graduated, thought that shit a charade
Only thing on they mind that wasn't me was get laid
Then one day, they had a falling out on the block
See, one thought the other one had been stealing his rock
'Cause he coulda sworn he had more weight in his stock
Pulled out the Glock and his homie yelled 'stop!'
But before he had the chance to pull the trigger, oh shit here come the cops
They saw the gun and blew them both away
Now there's two more kids dead in the street all before twenty
Over me, the most important thing to man, money!
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch
Like Sinatra, screamin', ""Motherfuck the cops""
We just some motherfuckin' KIDS
We just some motherfuckin' KIDS
We love and miss you Mac
For those of y'all who don't know man
Mac is the whole reason that I started doing this Young Sinatra shit
I remember I loved Lord Finesse, all the shit he did with DITC, Diggin in the Crates
Hip to the Game, one of the illest beats ever and
I remember when Mac flipped that shit for KoolAid and Frozen Pizza
I thought it was the dopest shit man
Mac showed me that I could just do it all on my own
Me and all my boys, all my homies and if it wasn't for him killing that beat
I would have never got on that beat for my very first mixtape Young Broke and Infamous, damn
It's like 2010 And I titled the track Young Sinatra
And that was the birth of all this shit
So, thank you, I appreciate you, love you and miss you, yeah
We just some motherfuckin' KIDS"

I Already Know,"
Man, Prince was a pimp, Apollonia, Vanity
Sheila E. had me on the edge of insanity
Swore if I made it in music I'd be similar
Here I am, this is the future, I'm where the woman are
Rocking with Tim and Bob, y'all need me, shine a spotlight up
In the sky like Batman, I pops right up
This is Nas, hate if you must hate
Been hot since the days of cassette tapes
T-shirts over the thermals dripped in our memories
Sipping that Hennessy .4-5th in my denim jeans
She told me she was my eyelashes
When we hump, I grunt just like a bull mastiff
They call me the best who ever did it
Only in the club one minute guess who I slip with
A chocolate dyke ghetto thing sweet
We going to pop tonight, bon appetit


Do you know who I am? And she says
La lalala I already know
What we can't hold hands? And she says
La lalala I already know
You got to leave by three? You with me?
La lalala I already know
So until next week? You know, ma
La lalala I already know


You know, mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the nastiest sexiest thug of them all?
I seen her in the mall, she was wearing home
Degarsole keyoke mose cherry cologne
She was looking very alone
'Til this big weightlifting Mr. Universe clone starts grabbing her own
But she can't stop looking I'm in the zone
One look at the kid she taking of her stone
Cash crazy, ass crazy, hair long
And baby amaze me because I'm in rare form
She like an ice cold bowl of post honeycomb
Followed me in the shop while I cop Nina Simone
Tap me on the shoulder I told her I'm on the phone
I played it off well nobody was on the cell
Shit, she said the tone?
She said, ""Excuse me mister so and so should I leave you alone?""
I said


Do you know who I am? And she says
La lalala I already know
What we can't hold hands? And she says

Tick-tock, tick-tock time is passing
Hello?
Turn the television off, focus here


You know, lover not a fighter
I'm the vagina liner re-constructor, bed sheet ruffler
For you freak girls undercover who loves ya?
I'm not a priest don't front for me, but step in my confessional
That's the bedroom, tell the truth I'll be impressional
Wait before you pass your collection plate
Show me you a professional so we straight?
She tried to kiss my lips, but no I don't do that
Want me to kiss my lips but not with a new jack
Few stacks spend my chips, yeah I do that
See the problem with you women is, look I got 'em
You can hear a mouse piss on cotton
You don't wanna miss it then listen, stop stressing the man
We out to get as much sex as we can
And you roll with the plan, shorty you lie
But you gotta leave, 2:45

My poor old head is a reelin',
As I go deep into the funnel of love.
I tried and I tried, to run and hide,
I even tried to run away,
You just can't run from the funnel of love,
It's gonna get you someday.

Preaching every step that I could.
You ain't heard my rock and roll music,
You ain't never seen nothing like me.
I can wash dishes down in Macon, Georgia
And help a blind eye to see.

Well I'm gonna a little this song of love for you one more time,

Lord, the beauty's on duty, you know we're gonna have a time.
Move on up to heaven.
Headed up the highway, feelin all right today.
All I got with me is my faith in Jesus,
To show me every step of the way.
Sticks can't burn me, fire can't turn me,
Away from my rock and roll road.
I got a rainbow round my beautiful face,
And I'm living in a pot of gold.
